# React-info-register
Personal information register using React with Validation 


This is a application which can basically record individuals information and also have the functionality to hide on the screen.

Build using react

it also has build-in input Validation.

It uses Email ID as a key hence it wont accept a Email ID more than once.

have plans to connect it to Backend later.
